<p>For mobile devices, the auto-correct functionality should be disabled for relevant inputs that include proper names, street names, email addresses, usernames, etc.</p>
<p>The auto-capitalisation functionality for the first letter of each text field and the first letter of each sentence should only be enabled where appropriate and if required by the locale.
