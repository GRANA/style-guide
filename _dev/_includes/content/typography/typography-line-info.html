<h1>line-height</h1>
<p>Line-height creates the spacing for text in order to maintain ledgibility for different type sizes. Furthermore, a component's structure, such as margin and padding are contigent on this value. It is important for elements to be attributed with the appropriate line-height.</p>

<p>We have three line-heights: tight, regular, and large. These line-heights do not need to be included as they are baked into the type size placeholders.</p>
